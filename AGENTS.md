# AGENTS.md

## What muxel is

muxel is a GPUI-based multi-agent terminal multiplexer (built on Zed's GPUI +
gpui-component): a tiled, tabbed workspace for running coding agents (Claude,
opencode, Amp, …) and shells side by side, with first-class git worktrees, agent
status tracking, and notifications. See `FEATURES.md` for the full feature list.

It's a native desktop GUI app (not a TUI) — each pane embeds a real terminal
emulator running a PTY child process.

## Architecture

Cargo workspace, four crates (depend downward only):

- `crates/muxel-core` — the **pure** domain model: the pane layout tree
  (`PaneNode`, `pane.rs`), worktree naming, agent presets (`AgentPreset`), tmux
  arg helpers, and the persisted `Workspace` / `Project` / `Instance` / `Settings`
  types. No UI, no I/O — fully unit-tested. Most logic that *can* live here,
  should. The old `control` / `readaloud` / `stt` / `tts` / `audio` / `ssh` /
  `remote_ops` / `winshell` modules were removed — this fork is local-only, so
  no voice, outside-control, or remote code lives here anymore.
- `crates/muxel-store` — persistence: workspaces, `workspace.json`, and settings,
  loaded/saved under the platform config/data dirs (XDG on Linux).
- `crates/muxel-terminal` — the PTY child + `alacritty_terminal` emulator
  (`TerminalSession`, `session.rs`), its GPUI view + custom paint element
  (`TerminalView`/`TerminalElement`, `view.rs`/`element.rs`), and agent status
  detection (`AgentStatus`, `classify`).
- `crates/muxel` — the GPUI application (`app.rs`, the large `MuxelApp` entity):
  window, sidebar, toolbar, pane rendering, settings UI (`settings_view.rs`),
  editor (`editor.rs`), git/tmux side effects (`integrations.rs`), and embedded
  assets (icons, themes) wired up in `main.rs`. The old `stt` / `tts` / `update` /
  `control` / `secrets` modules were removed — no speech, in-app updater,
  outside-control, or keychain code lives here anymore.

`ios/` — a separate **Swift/SwiftUI iOS companion app**, intentionally kept
as-is. It is **not** a cargo crate — the `cargo` gate does not build it. It
re-implements a **historical** slice of `muxel-core`'s old *remote protocol*
(tmux session naming, `RemoteLayout` `.muxel/workspace.json`, `classify`/markers)
from the era when desktop muxel supported remote/SSH projects. Desktop muxel no
longer implements remote/SSH at all, so nothing on the Rust side speaks that
protocol any more — `ios/` is kept as a snapshot of it and deliberately does not
track the desktop code. See `ios/README.md`.

### Key concepts

- **Pane tree** — a project's layout is `Option<PaneNode>`: `Leaf(LeafData {
  tabs: Vec<Uuid>, active })` (a tab group) or `Split { direction, sizes,
  children }`. Mutations (`split`, `add_tab`, `move_tab_to`, `move_into_split`,
  `move_pane_beside`, `remove`, …) are pure functions in `pane.rs` with tests.
- **Instance vs terminal** — an `Instance` is persisted metadata (id, program,
  worktree, …); the live `TerminalView`/PTY is owned by the app, keyed by instance
  id in `MuxelApp.terminals`. Runtime-only state (e.g. `AgentStatus`) is **not**
  persisted.
- **Back-compat persistence** — every new field on a persisted struct gets
  `#[serde(default)]` so older `workspace.json` / settings still load. Bump
  `PRESET_SEED_VERSION` when adding a built-in preset so existing workspaces merge it.
- **GPUI patterns** — render builds an element tree with `div()…`; handlers use
  `cx.listener(|this, ev, window, cx| …)`; the terminal is a custom `Element`
  (manual layout/paint). Mouse `on_drag_move` fires for all listeners — guard with
  `ev.bounds.contains(&ev.event.position)`.
- **Native webview overlay rule** — browser panes (`browser.rs`) are native child
  windows that draw ABOVE all gpui content. `MuxelApp::any_overlay_open` must list
  **every** modal/palette/menu/drag flag; when you add a new overlay, add its flag
  there or the webview will float over it.

## Building & testing a feature

cargo is installed via rustup (`~/.cargo/bin/cargo`).

Run this gate after any change, and fix everything before considering it done:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings   # warnings are errors
cargo test --workspace                                   # unit/integration tests
cargo build -p muxel                                     # the GUI binary
```

- **Where tests go** — pure logic in `muxel-core` (pane ops, worktree, presets,
  settings seeding) is unit-tested there; prefer extracting decision logic into
  pure, testable functions (e.g. `classify` in `view.rs`). `muxel-terminal` has
  integration-style tests that spawn a real PTY.
- **gpui `#[test]` gotcha** — in a file that does `use gpui::*`, `#[test]`
  resolves to gpui's attribute macro. In test modules, import only what you need
  (`use super::{Foo, bar}`) instead of `use super::*` so the built-in `#[test]` is
  used.

### Verifying GUI changes

Unit tests can't see the UI, so for anything visual:

- **Smoke test** (does it launch without panicking?) — run the binary against an
  isolated workspace for a few seconds; "ok" means it stayed up:

  ```sh
  s=$(mktemp -d)
  HOME="$s" XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$s/config" XDG_DATA_HOME="$s/data" \
    ./target/debug/muxel >/dev/null 2>&1 & pid=$!
  sleep 5
  if kill -0 $pid 2>/dev/null; then echo ok; kill $pid; else wait $pid; echo "exited early: $?"; fi
  rm -rf "$s"
  ```

  **Isolation must override `HOME`, not just the `XDG_*` vars.** The `directories`
  crate honours `XDG_*` only on Linux; on macOS it ignores them and uses
  `~/Library/Application Support/dev.muxel.muxel` — the real workspace, possibly
  with the user's own muxel running on it. It does follow `$HOME`, so setting both
  covers Linux and macOS. The script backgrounds and kills the process rather than
  using `timeout`, which macOS doesn't ship.

- **Interactive** — `scripts/dev.sh` runs muxel against an isolated sandbox
  (`.muxel-dev/`) so testing never touches the real workspace. A fresh workspace shows
  the first-run welcome dialog; accepted-terms / window geometry / layout live
  under the sandbox's data dir. Args go to cargo (`--release`); anything after `--`
  goes to muxel. On Linux it isolates with `XDG_*`; on macOS (where those are
  ignored) it builds first, then runs only the binary with `HOME` set to
  `.muxel-dev/home` — so agents in its panes start without your login/config.
- State each visual behavior that needs a human's eyes — the harness can build and
  smoke-test, but can't see colors/layout.

## Features doc

`FEATURES.md` (repo root) is the canonical catalogue of user-facing features.
**When you add or change a user-facing feature, update `FEATURES.md` in the same
change** — add or edit its entry under the right category (sentence or two each;
add a new `##` category if none fits).

## Git commits

- Never put personal email, phone, home paths, API keys, or session URLs in commits.
- Do not append `Claude-Session:`, `Co-Authored-By:`, or other attribution trailers unless I explicitly ask.
- Before committing, run `git config user.email` and confirm it is the project's intended commit identity (not a personal address).
- Commit messages: subject + body only — no tooling metadata or session links.
